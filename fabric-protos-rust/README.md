# fabric_gateway_protos

Rust library for encoding and decoding Hyperledger Fabric Gateway messages (generated)

## Work in progress

Attempting to use [protobuf-codegen crate](https://crates.io/crates/protobuf-codegen) with [bufbuild](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)

Code generation appears to work, however the resulting code does not compile. Seems to be related to a [known issue](https://github.com/stepancheg/grpc-rust/issues/192) unfortunately while that issue has been fixed, I haven't managed to generate code with a matching version of rust-protobuf.

The grpc-compiler seems to pick up the right versions...

```
cargo install grpc-compiler --version 0.8.3 --locked
    Updating crates.io index
  Installing grpc-compiler v0.8.3
   Compiling protobuf v2.18.2
   Compiling protobuf-codegen v2.18.2
   Compiling grpc-compiler v0.8.3
```

Unfortunately the generated files include...

```
// This file is generated by rust-protobuf 2.20.0. Do not edit
// @generated
```

## TODO

This kind of thing might be useful for `lib.rs`:
